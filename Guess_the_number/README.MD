# Guess The Number

## The computer picks a number (from 1 to 20). Your task is to guess this number. If the entered number is the guessed number, you win.
## If not, the computer reports whether the entered number is greater or less than the guessed number.
## Each attempt is worth 1 point (the maximum is 20 points).
